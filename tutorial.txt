Create the directory for your projects. Below is a suggestion for directory structure starting in your user folder. Creatre a projects folder inside your user folder. Then create a CSXWebsite folder inside the projects folder.
Example: (user)/projects/CSXWebsite/

Download Python 3.8 (Make sure to select create PATH variable)

*** Mac users: open terminal
*** Windows users: 
Download and install GIT BASH terminal from 
https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.24.0.windows.2/Git-2.24.0.2-64-bit.exe

Navigate to the projects directory using:
cd projects/CSXWebsite

configure your git settings:
git config user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config user.email "YOUR EMAIL"

update pip (a commandline based installation tool):
py -m pip install --upgrade pip


Next we will install virtualenv. This allows you to create a virtual environment for the project and seperate any installed packages for this project from other projects on your computer:
pip install virtualenv

Clone the current version of the website to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/BHCC-CSX/CSXWebsite.git

Create and activate a virtual environment:
py -m venv env
*** windows users *** source env/scripts/activate 
*** mac users: *** source env/bin/activate

Install the required packages (including Django!):
pip install -r requirements.txt

You should now be able to deploy the website locally by running the following command:
py manage.py runserver
